Inline markup
-------------


* one asterisk: ``*text*`` for emphasis (italics),
* two asterisks: ``**text**`` for strong emphasis (boldface), and
* backquotes: ````text```` for code samples.

Lists
-----

List markup is natural: just place an asterisk at the start of a paragraph and indent properly. The same goes for numbered lists; they can also be autonumbered using a # sign:

.. code-block:: txt

	* This is a bulleted list.
	* It has two items, the second
	  item uses two lines.

	1. This is a numbered list.
	2. It has two items too.

	#. This is a numbered list.
	#. It has two items too.
	
Nested lists
++++++++++++

Nested lists are possible, but be aware that they must be separated from the parent list items by blank lines:

.. code-block:: txt

	* this is
	* a list

	  * with a nested list
	  * and some subitems

	* and here the parent list continues
	
Hyperlinks
----------

Use ```Link text <http://example.com/>`_`` for inline web links. If the link text should be the web address, you donâ€™t need special markup at all, the parser finds links and mail addresses in ordinary text.

You can also separate the link and the target definition, like this:

.. code-block:: txt

	This is a paragraph that contains `a link`_.

	.. _a link: http://example.com/
