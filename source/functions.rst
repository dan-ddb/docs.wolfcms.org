Functions
=========

The "functions" section houses pages that provide more detailed information about individual functions of Wolf CMS. These pages serve as an additional source of information on top of the PHPDoc references. These function pages may be out of date since they are manually maintained. 

Author
------

Wolf saves the id of the user who creates a page, and the name for that id can be displayed using author(). This is commonly given in the page's “meta”, for example: 

.. code-block:: php

	<p class="meta">Posted by <?php echo $this->author(); ?></p>
	
See also the updater() function.
