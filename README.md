Wolf CMS Documentation
======================

Do you feel our documentation misses some points? We welcome additions!

The best way is to [submit a pull request](https://github.com/wolfcms/docs.wolfcms.org/pulls) against our
GitHub repository. If you don't know how to make these changes, we still want to hear your input. You can
[submit a feature request](https://github.com/wolfcms/docs.wolfcms.org/issues) explaining your suggested improvements.

All of the documentation on [docs.wolfcms.org](http://docs.wolfcms.org) is written in Markdown using the most excellent [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org) system.
