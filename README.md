Wolf CMS Documentation
======================

Do you feel our documentation misses some points? We welcome additions; just let us know how you think the documentation
can be improved. The best way is to [submit a pull request](https://github.com/wolfcms/docs.wolfcms.org/pulls) against our
GitHub repository. If you don't know how to make these changes, we still want to hear your input. You can
[submit a feature request](https://github.com/wolfcms/docs.wolfcms.org/issues) explaining your suggested improvements.

Also documentation does not have to be text only, we would welcome to have some video tutorials giving users hints how
to do specific tasks inside Wolf CMS.

The [docs.wolfcms.org](http://docs.wolfcms.org) website uses Sphinx and the [Read the Docs](http://readthedocs.org) service to provide you with excellent documentation.
