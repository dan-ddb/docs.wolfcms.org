docs.wolfcms.org
================

Do you feel our documentation misses some points? We welcome additions; just let us know how you think the documentation
can be improved. The best way is to submit a pull request against our docs.wolfcms.org GitHub repository. If you don't
know how to make these changes, we still want to hear your input. You can submit a feature request explaining your
suggested improvements.

Also documentation does not have to be text only, we would welcome to have some video tutorials giving users hints how
to do specific tasks inside Wolf CMS.

The docs.wolfcms.org website uses Sphinx and the Readthedocs.org service to provide you with excellent documentation.
