Configuration
=============

All configurable data is placed in `config.php`. If this file does not exist something went wrong during `installation`. This file only needs to contain the parameters you want to change from their corresponding default values.

If a directive is missing from your file, you can just add another line within the file. This file is for over-writing the defaults; if you wish to use the default value there's no need to add a directive.

You should assume that any configuration directives that were generated by the installation routine of Wolf CMS are *required* to be there or have no default value for some reason.

!!! warning
    `Mac` users should note that if you are on a version before `Mac OS X`, PHP does not seem to like `Mac` end of lines character (`\r`). So ensure you choose the option that allows to use the \*nix end of line character (`\n`) in your text editor before saving a modified `config.php`.

Using clean URLs
----------------

The default installation of Wolf CMS generates a question mark in the URLs it generates. This is for compatibility purposes, so Wolf CMS will run on almost any HTTP server by default.

However, most people (and search engines) don't really like this question mark. You can disable/remove the question mark after you installed Wolf CMS.

By default, Wolf CMS supports Apache. Other HTTP servers are supported based on user input.

!!! important
    You must carry out **both** the "General actions" **as well as** the additional instructions for your specific web server (Apache, Lighttpd, Nginx, etc.).

### General actions

The following actions should always be executed in order for Wolf CMS to use clean urls.

1. Temporarily add write permissions to the `config.php` file and edit it.
2. Change the value of the `USE_MOD_REWRITE` setting to `true`.
3. Save the file and remove the write permissions again.
4. Apply the directions for your specific HTTP server. See `rewrite`.

After applying the directions, test out the change by going to the root of your website. You should no longer see the question mark.

The username required to connect to the database. This string is generated based on the selections you made during the installation phase.

----

Type: boolean
Default: false

Change this setting to enable the use of mod_rewrite. When set to `true`, Wolf CMS tries to remove the "?" in the `URL`. For this to succeed, a correct set of rewrite rules will have to be configured.

Additionally, to enable mod_rewrite, you must also change the name of `_.htaccess` in your root directory to `.htaccess`.

----

**define('URL_SUFFIX', ...)**

Type: string
Default: `.html`

This option allows you to add a default suffix to your page `URLs` to, for example, simulate static pages.

----

Generic settings

----

**define('ADMIN_DIR', ...)**

Type: string
Default: `admin`

The name of the `HTTP` path, also known as a virtual directory, that your site's administration section lives behind.

----

**define('USE_POORMANSCRON', ...)**

Type: boolean
Default: false

Whether or not to use a so-called `web bug` to run `CRON` runs when users visit your site. If your site does not get any hits, the poorman's cron run will never take place.

----

**define('POORMANSCRON_INTERVAL', ...)**

Type: integer
Default: 3600 (60 minutes)

The minimum amount of time in seconds between two `CRON` runs when using the poorman's cron option.

----

**define('COOKIE_LIFE', ...)**

----

Security settings
-----------------

----

**define('USE_HTTPS', ...)**

Type: boolean

----

**define('COOKIE_HTTP_ONLY', ...)**

Type: boolean
Default: false

Whether or not to use a so-called `HttpOnly`[^1] authentication cookie instead of a unprotected one. This *requests* browsers to make the cookie only available through HTTP, so not javascript for example. There is no guarantee the browser honors the request, but `OWASP` recommends using it. Defaults to false for backwards compatibility.

[^1]: See [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HttpOnly]() for more details.

----

**define('DELAY_ONCE_EVERY', ...)**

----

**define('DELAY_FIRST_AFTER', ...)**

Type: integer
Default: 3

The number of invalid login attempts to an account that are permitted before Wolf CMS starts to (temporarily) block further login attempts.

----

**define('SECURE_TOKEN_EXPIRY', ...)**

Type: integer
Default: 900 (15 minutes)

The amount of time in seconds before a security token, otherwise known as an `CSRF token`, is no longer deemed valid. If a user tries to undertake an action, like saving a page, after the token has expired, the system will display an `Invalid CSRF token..` message.

Simply re-attemting the same action will allow the user to continue.

!!! warning
    The `CSRF token` is considered a very important feature to help protect against hackers stealing a user's session information and abusing that account. We **strongly** advise not setting this value too high.

    These settings might have huge effect on performance or security.

----
